/**
 * "A currency pair is the quotation of the relative value of a currency unit against the unit of
 * another currency in the foreign exchange market.
 *
 * The currency that is used as the reference is
 * called the counter currency, quote currency or currency and the currency that is quoted in
 * relation is called the base currency or transaction currency.
 *
 * "The quotation EUR/USD 1.2500 means that one euro is exchanged for 1.2500 US dollars. Here, EUR
 * is the base currency and USD is the quote currency(counter currency)."
 *
 * Ref: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_pair)
 *
 * Thus BTC/USD=1000 means that one BTC is changed for $1,000.  Here, BTC is the base currency
 * and USD is the quote currency.  You would create such an exchange with:
 *
 *    let BTC_USD_Pair = CurrencyPair (baseUnit:  Bitcoin.Units.BTC,
 *                                     quoteUnit: Fiat.USD.Dollar,
 *                                     exchangeRate: 1000.0)
 *
 * and then use it to find the value of 2 BTC with:
 *
 *    BTC_USD_Pair.exchange (asBase: Amount (value: 2.0, unit: Bitcoin.Units.BTC))
 *
 * which would return: $2,000  (as Amount of 2000.0 in Fiat.USD.Dollar)
