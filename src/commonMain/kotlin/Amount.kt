         *  * if it starts with '0x', it is interpreted as a 'hex string'
         *  * if it has a decimal point, it is interpreted as a 'decimal string'

         * If it is a 'decimal string' and the string includes values after the decimal point, then
         * the number of values must be less than or equal to the unit's decimals.  For example a
         * string of "1.1" in BTC_SATOSHI won't parse as BTC_SATOSHI has 0 decimals (it is a base unit
         * and thus must be an integer).  Whereas, a string of "1.1" in BTC_BTC will parse as BTC_BTC
         * has 8 decimals and the string has but one.  ("0.123456789" won't parse as it has 9 digits
         * after the decimal; both "1." and "1.0" will parse.)
         *
         * Additionally, `string` cannot have any extraneous starting or ending characters.  Said
         * another way, `string` must be fully consumed.  Thus "10w" and "w10" and "1.1w" won't parse.
         *
         * @param string the string to parse
         * @param unit the string's unit
         * @param isNegative true if negative; false otherwise
         *
         * @return The `Amount` if the string can be parsed.
