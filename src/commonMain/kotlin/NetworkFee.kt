 * A Network Fee represents the 'amount per cost factor' paid to mine a transfer.

 * transfer depends on properties of the transfer; for BTC, the cost factor is 'size in kB';
 * for ETH, the cost factor is 'gas'.
 *
 * A Network supports a variety of fees.  Essentially the higher the fee the more enticing the
 * transfer is to a miner and thus the more quickly the transfer gets into the block chain.
 *
 * A NetworkFee is Equatable on the underlying Core representation.  It is natural to compare
 * NetworkFee based on timeIntervalInMilliseconds.
