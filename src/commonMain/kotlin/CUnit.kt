/**
 * A unit of measure for a currency.
 *
 * There can be multiple units for a given currency (analogous to 'System International'
 * units of (meters, kilometers, miles, ...) for a dimension of 'length').  For example,
 * Ethereum has units of: WEI, GWEI, ETHER, METHER, ... and Bitcoin of: BTC, SATOSHI, ...
 *
 * Each Currency has a 'baseUnit' - which is defined as the 'integer-ish' unit - such as SATOSHI
 * ane WEI for Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively.  There can be multiple 'derivedUnits' - which
 * are derived by scaling off of a baseUnit.  For example, BTC and ETHER respectively.
